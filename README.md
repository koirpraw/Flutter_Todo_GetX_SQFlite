# Flutter Todo App- GetX and SQFLite.

Todo app with Persistent Local Storage using SQFLite. State management using GetX. MVC architecture used.
Used a reactive approach to update the UI so that the UI is updated automatically when the data changes. 
This makes UI rebuild and state changes pretty instant and smooth.SQLite offers a great solution for large storage needs and easily stored 
in the device.
The simple todo app illustrates the CRUD(Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations that can be easily applied to different ideas and approaches.
Task manager/ simple todo app is a great way to learn state management and storage solutions as well.
This app uses dismissible cards to delete tasks and snackbar to show task deleted messages. Both these features offer
a simple and smooth animation/ transition effect to improve the user experience.
This project can be easily customized to make other type of notes/ events/ tasks/ reminders/ tracking apps.
